## quickquote
A custom Drupal module that provides an instant price quote for a selected item.

Written in php using Drupal's Form API, this module provides a form page where a
category is selected, then an item under that category. The user will then enter
the number of items required and the screen will return an instant price quote,
along with the cost per item.

This instant quoting system is useful for small businesses who don't require a
full e-commerce solution. It was originally made for a company providing
laboratory services, but can also be used and adapted for other services and
products. It could also be used as an internal system to provide quick pricing
information for company employees.
